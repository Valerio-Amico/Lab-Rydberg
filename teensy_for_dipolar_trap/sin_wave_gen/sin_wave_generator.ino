  Sine/Square Wave Generator
  JK
  
  Teensy 3.1 (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html, Farnell order code SC13539, Â£16.99 ex VAT)
  
  Generates a Sine Wave with specified frequency at 12-bit resolution of DAC output
  Cycles through values in the Waveforms.h lookup file, which are created from 
  a python script and copied in manually
  
  The Teensy is used in preference to the Arduino DUE because the DAC output range
  is the full 0 to 3V3 range, rather than 1/6 to 5/6 of the range. It's also a fair
  bit cheaper, the clock speed is higher (overclocked), and it has a much smaller 
  physical footprint. Buy one, they're great!
  
  ** Original purpose - custom lock-in amplifier reference oscillator signal for use with
     a Faraday-filter laser system being developed in Durham University's Atomic and 
     Molecular Physics group
